Rest in pie ces, 
down for the count.

No re vi val, 
you're blee din' out.

Your epitaph says 
you died a weal thy man,
But you can have it all come back and
Seal the mas ter plan with Tomb stone!

It's Tomb stone! 
It's Tomb stone! 
It's Tomb stone!

Health is drain in', 
you're on the ropes.

Death is wait in', 
don't lose your hopes.

Your will and test ament 
ain't making that much sense,

You're listed as the only heir 
to whom you may bequest.

It's Tomb stone! 
It's Tomb stone! 
It's Tomb stone!
It's Tomb stone!
